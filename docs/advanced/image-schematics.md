# Image Schematics

TEdit can convert image files into tile-based pixel art that you can paste into your world.

## How It Works

1. Go to **Plugins > Image to Schematic** (or similar menu entry)
2. Select an image file (PNG, JPG, BMP)
3. TEdit maps each pixel color to the closest matching Terraria tile
4. The result is loaded into the [Clipboard](../sidebar-panels/clipboard.md) as a schematic
5. Paste it into your world

## Tips

- **Smaller images work better** — A 100x100 pixel image becomes 100x100 tiles
- **Reduce colors first** — Terraria has a limited tile color palette
- Simple pixel art with bold shapes produces the best results
- Use the **Clipboard** to export the schematic for reuse
