# Status Bar

The status bar runs along the bottom of the editor and shows context about what's under your cursor.

## Information Displayed

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Position** | Cursor X, Y coordinates in tile units |
| **Tile** | Tile type and ID under the cursor |
| **Wall** | Wall type and ID under the cursor |
| **Paint** | Paint color applied to the tile/wall |
| **Selection** | Current selection dimensions (if active) |

This bar updates in real-time as you move the cursor across the map. It's especially useful with the Arrow tool for inspecting what's on the map without making changes.
