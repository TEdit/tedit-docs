TEdit 5 is a complete redesign of the Terraria Map Editor. Edit worlds like paint — place tiles, walls, liquids, and wire with brushes and fills. Edit chests, signs, and NPCs. Build epic dungeons, castles, cities, and adventure maps.

**What's new in TEdit 5:**

- **Fluent Design** — Modern WPF-UI interface with dark mode
- **Scripting** — Write JavaScript or Lua scripts to automate edits
- **Find Panel** — Search your world for items, tiles, walls, and sprites
- **Filter Panel** — Hide or grayscale specific tile types for clearer editing
- **Localization** — UI translated into 13 languages
- **Auto-Update** — Stable, Beta, and Alpha update channels via Velopack
- **Modernized Settings** — Searchable, categorized settings window
