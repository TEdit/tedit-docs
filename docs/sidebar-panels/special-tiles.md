## Display Doll Editor

Display dolls (also called mannequins in some contexts) support pose editing in addition to equipment slots.

Right-click a display doll with the Arrow tool to open its editor. In addition to equipping armor and vanity items, you can select a **pose** for the doll:

- Browse available poses from the pose dropdown
- The doll's frame updates in the world view when a pose is selected

This allows you to arrange display dolls in different stances for decorative builds.
