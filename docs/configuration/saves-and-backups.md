# Saves and Backups

:::danger
**Always back up your world files before editing!** TEdit modifies world files directly.
:::

## Saving

- **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) — Overwrites the currently open world file
- **Save As** (`Ctrl+Shift+S`) — Save to a new file location

## Auto-Save

When enabled in [Settings](settings.md), TEdit periodically saves your work automatically. This protects against crashes and accidental data loss.

## Backup Tips

- Keep a copy of your original `.wld` file before editing
- Terraria world files are located at: `Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`
- Use **Save As** to create named versions of your edits (e.g., `MyWorld-v2.wld`)
- Consider using the [Clipboard](../sidebar-panels/clipboard.md) to export schematics of important builds

## Undo / Redo

TEdit supports undo (`Ctrl+Z`) and redo (`Ctrl+Y`) for most operations. The undo history is stored in memory and is lost when you close the editor.
