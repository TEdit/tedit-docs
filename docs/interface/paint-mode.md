# Paint Mode

The paint mode dropdown controls what the Pencil, Brush, and Fill tools affect. Switch modes to paint different layer types.

## Tile/Wall Mode

![Tile Mode](/img/v5/interface/brush-tile-mode-options.png)

The default mode. Select a tile type and/or wall type from the dropdowns. The ID number is shown next to each selection.

**Eraser toggle** — When enabled (highlighted), painting removes tiles/walls instead of placing them.

### Masks

Masks control *where* painting takes effect:

| Mask Mode | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Disable Mask | Paint anywhere |
| Edit Empty | Only paint over empty space |
| Edit Matching | Only paint over tiles/walls matching the mask type |

Set the mask type in the Mask dropdown — it has the same tile/wall options as the main selector.

### Coatings

You can also apply paint colors and coatings (Echo, Illuminant, Full Bright) to tiles and walls.

## Wire Mode
