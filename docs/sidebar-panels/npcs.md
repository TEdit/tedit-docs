# NPCs

The NPC panel lets you manage town NPCs in your world — add or remove them, edit display names, toggle shimmer/party state, and quickly navigate to their location on the map.

## Search Filter

Use the **Search** box at the top of the panel to filter NPCs by name. The filter matches against the NPC's default type name (e.g. "Nurse", "Merchant") and is case-insensitive.

## Adding and Removing NPCs

- Click the **+** button next to an NPC that is not on the map to add it at the world spawn point.
- Click the **-** button next to an NPC that is on the map to remove it from the world.

## Editing NPC Properties

When an NPC is on the map, the following options are available:

- **Display Name** — Edit the custom name shown in-game above the NPC.
- **Shimmered** — Toggle whether the NPC has been shimmered (only available for NPCs that support shimmer).
- **Partying** — Toggle whether the NPC is currently partying.
- **Variant Selector** — For NPCs with multiple visual variants (e.g. town pets), a dropdown lets you pick which variant to use.

## Go To Location

Right-click any NPC that is on the map to instantly zoom in and pan the map to the NPC's current position.
