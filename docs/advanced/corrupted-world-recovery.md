# Corrupted World Recovery

If your Terraria world file is corrupted and won't load in-game, TEdit may still be able to open and repair it.

## Steps

1. **Open the world in TEdit** — TEdit can sometimes load worlds that Terraria rejects
2. **Inspect for damage** — Look for missing chunks, scrambled tiles, or holes in terrain
3. **Repair manually** — Use the Brush and Fill tools to patch damaged areas
4. **Save As a new file** — Don't overwrite the original in case you need to try again

## Terraria Backup Files

Terraria automatically creates `.wld.bak` backup files. Check your worlds folder:

`Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`

Rename the `.wld.bak` file to `.wld` to try loading the backup.

## Prevention

- Always use **Save As** to create backups before major edits
- Enable **Autosave** in [Settings](../configuration/settings.md)
- Keep copies of important worlds in a separate folder
